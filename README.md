# Grading Application
Developed by Brendan Cook for coursework at The University of Toledo

Installation:

To install the program, run the .ps1 file located in the "Application Install" folder by right clicking the file and selecting "Run with PowerShell".    
Upon successful installation, a .JAR file will be placed on your desktop for you to be able to access the application.

The application allows users to add/edit students, assignments,
and grades, as well as view all grades within a table for quick and easy access to the information. The
application is written in Java and the installation script is written in PowerShell. The application uses CSV
files as the storage medium and was picked because Java and its libraries have good support for being
able to read/write to CSV files. In addition, users can open the files up and export them as a table using
Microsoft Excel if desired.
